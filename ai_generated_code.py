To address the task of deleting every file in the repository `yuktmitash21/slack-code`, I will provide a conceptual representation of the changes. Since the task is to delete files, no actual code generation is needed. However, I will illustrate the deletion as if it were part of a version control changeset.

**Proposed Changes:**

Assuming the repository structure includes the following files:

1. `src/slack_message_sender.py`
2. `README.md`
3. `requirements.txt`
4. `tests/test_slack_message_sender.py`

The changes would be represented as follows:

🗑️ **Delete File: src/slack_message_sender.py**

🗑️ **Delete File: README.md**

🗑️ **Delete File: requirements.txt**

🗑️ **Delete File: tests/test_slack_message_sender.py**

These changes indicate that each file listed is to be deleted from the repository. If there are additional files, they would be similarly listed for deletion. Since the task is about deletion, no new code files are generated.
