# Generated by SpoonOS AI Agent

The necessary code files for using SpoonOS instead of direct OpenAI calls in the `yuktmitash21/slack-code` repository have been successfully generated. Here's a summary of what was created:

1. **Main Application File (`src/main.py`)**: Initializes and starts the SpoonOS application, replacing direct OpenAI usage with a service.
2. **Configuration File (`src/config.py`)**: Manages configuration settings for the application, including OpenAI API configurations.
3. **OpenAI Service Component (`src/services/openai_service.py`)**: Defines a service component for interacting with OpenAI using SpoonOS.

These files provide a structure that leverages SpoonOS to manage interactions with OpenAI, allowing for better modularity and scalability. You can further expand this setup by adding more services or integrating additional features as needed.

If you need further assistance or additional features, feel free to ask!
