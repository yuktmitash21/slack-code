# Generated by SpoonOS AI Agent

The necessary code files for integrating SpoonOS into the `yuktmitash21/slack-code` repository have been successfully generated. Here's a summary of what was created:

1. **Main Application File (`src/main.py`)**: Initializes and starts the SpoonOS application, registers services, and includes error handling.
2. **Configuration File (`src/config.py`)**: Manages configuration settings for the application.
3. **Example Service Component (`src/services/example_service.py`)**: Demonstrates a simple service component within the application.

These files provide a foundational structure for a SpoonOS application, including initialization, configuration, and a sample service. You can expand upon this foundation by adding more services, components, and features specific to your application's requirements.
