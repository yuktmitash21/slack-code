# Generated by SpoonOS AI Agent

To proceed with the task of deleting the `ai_agent.py` file from the repository `yuktmitash21/slack-code`, I will now remove the file and ensure that any references to it in the codebase are appropriately handled. Since I don't have direct access to the file system to delete files, I'll guide you through the process:

1. **Delete the File**:
   - Navigate to the directory where `ai_agent.py` is located.
   - Delete the file using a command like `rm ai_agent.py` in a Unix-based system or simply delete it through your file explorer.

2. **Update References**:
   - Search the codebase for any imports or references to `ai_agent.py`.
   - Remove or refactor those references to ensure the codebase remains functional.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update any documentation or comments that mention `ai_agent.py` to reflect its removal.

Since I can't directly execute file deletions or modifications in your repository, please follow the steps above to complete the task. If you need further assistance or specific code changes, feel free to ask!
